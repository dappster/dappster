# Dappster
A P2P file sharing tracker service built on top on the Ethereum virtual machine

### The problem
Torrents enable the community to share large files in a completely peer-to-peer way, to enable fast file transfer rates without an expensive centralized service.  Unfortunately, there is no good way to connect torrents together.  Before blockchains were invented, torrents were connected by magnet links only found on centralized websites, which are susceptible to takedowns, attacks, and more.  Without magnet links, torrenters cannot find other torrenters.  

### The solution
Dappster is not a website.  It is not a piece of software.  It is a protocol to allow for the sharing of magnet links on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a worldwide decentralized cloud server.  Plugins (will) exist for desktop torrenting software to use the Dappster protocol smart-contracts in the EVM to write and read magnet link information.  Since the EVM does charge micro-fees for these operations, it will cost small amounts of money.  Similar to the amounts of money exchanged when viewing ads on the sides of centralized websites.
